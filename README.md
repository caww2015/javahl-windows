# Subclipse JavaHL Plugins with Windows Binaries

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/subclipse/javahl-windows.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/subclipse/javahl-windows)

This repository contains the Subclipse plugin fragments for JavaHL on Windows.
This delivers the Windows DLL's in a plugin fragment and is contained in a
separate repository to keep the DLL's out of the main repository.

There is also no need to build these fragments other than when a new SVN
release is available.
